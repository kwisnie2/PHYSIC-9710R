Class stuff for the Atmospheric Physics 

My email is kwisnie2@uwo.ca if you need.

I have both my presentation and reflection uploaded. 

My presentation was on thetopic of the Ionosphere and thedecay of the E and F regions. As well as looking at radio wave propagations. 
I didn't have a lot of hand written notes, but please refer to my references for a grerat list of textbooks I used very closely for this project.
